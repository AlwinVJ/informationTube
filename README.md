I designed a YouTube clone website using HTML and CSS, replicating the platform’s layout and visual design. During the development process, I referred to various documentation sources and video tutorials to understand responsive design techniques and modern styling practices. The project includes key sections such as a navigation bar, sidebar, video thumbnails, and play page. This project was created solely for educational and learning purposes to strengthen my front-end development skills. I have not used any original YouTube assets, including logos, icons, or brand elements such as YouTube Premium, Shorts, or other official graphics, to ensure there are no copyright or trademark issues — all visuals were designed independently.
